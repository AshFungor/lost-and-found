# Lost and found game

A game about *[HIDDEN]*

## Build

Download assets and put them (5 .zip archives) in root/assets directory. Then run helper
script to encrypt those, then, depending on your platform:

Run on linux:

    make build

On windows:

    make -f win-makefile

Executable is located in build/dist.


## Assets

Assets can be acquired [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1o65SOtIWnBjXbvFFNcbTfnj3iSbFhUrM?usp=drive_link),
for the reason that they are too large to store in repo, and I'm too poor to afford data packs.
